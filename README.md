# GranQ: Efficient Channel-wise Quantization via Vectorized Pre-Scaling for Zero-Shot QAT
This repository is the official code for the paper "GranQ: Efficient Channel-wise Quantization via Vectorized Pre-Scaling for Zero-Shot QAT" by Inpyo Hong, Youngwan Jo, Hyojeong Lee, Sunghyun Ahn, Kijung Lee and Sanghyun Park.

## Abstract
Zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) enables neural network compression
without original training data, making it a promising solution for
restricted data access scenarios. To compensate for the lack of data,
recent ZSQ methods typically rely on synthetic inputs generated
from the full-precision model. However, these synthetic inputs
often lead to activation distortion, especially under low-bit settings.
To mitigate this, existing methods typically employ per-channel
scaling, but they still struggle due to the severe computational
overhead during the accumulation process. To overcome this critical
bottleneck, we propose GranQ, a novel activation quantization
framework that introduces an efficient pre-scaling strategy. Unlike
conventional channel-wise methods that repeatedly perform scaling
operations during accumulation, GranQ applies scaling factors in a
pre-scaling step through fully vectorized computation, eliminating
runtime scaling overhead. This design enables GranQ to maintain
fine-grained quantization accuracy while significantly reducing
computational burden, particularly in low-bit quantization settings.
Extensive experiments under quantization-aware training (QAT)
settings demonstrate that GranQ consistently outperforms state-ofthe-
art ZSQ methods across CIFAR and ImageNet. In particular, our
method achieves up to 5.45% higher accuracy in the 3-bit setting on
CIFAR-100 and even surpasses the full-precision baseline on CIFAR-
10. The official code is available at https://github.com/Inpyo-Hong/GranQ.
